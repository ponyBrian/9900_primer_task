## 📚 Background (15%)

### a. Problem Definition and Impact
- Pediatric speech disorders are common; early intervention is crucial.
- SLPs face challenges managing patients, customizing exercises, and tracking progress.
- Current systems lack integrated management platforms; inefficiency and poor analytics.
- We propose a database-driven system to enable efficient management and analytics for SLPs.

### b. Review of Existing Systems
- Analyze at least two existing systems (e.g., Speech Blubs, existing Say66 platform).
- For each system, discuss:
  - **Problem it solves**
  - **Strengths to leverage**
  - **Limitations our solution will address**
- Cite academic/industry sources using APA or Harvard referencing.

## 🧩 User Stories & Sprints (25%)

### a. Scope Statement (≤100 words)
> Deliverable: A web-based platform enabling SLPs to manage patients, assign exercises, track progress, and generate reports. The platform includes a relational database, RESTful backend, and web frontend. Tablet game development and AI features are out of scope.  

Include **Client Approval (date and method of confirmation).**

### b. Sprint 1 User Stories
- Example functionalities:
  - SLP login
  - Child profile management
  - Exercise creation
  - Basic progress tracking
- Each User Story must include:
  - Connextra format
  - Jira issue key
  - Story Points and Priority
  - Acceptance Criteria

### c. Product Backlog
- User stories for Sprint 2 & 3 (unassigned)
- To include: advanced analytics, report generation, tablet integration, etc.
- Jira screenshots with full text included.

### d. Sprint Timeline and Milestones
| Sprint | Period            | Main Focus             |
|--------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| Sprint 1 | Week 3 → Week 5  | Core system foundation |
| Sprint 2 | Week 5 → Week 8  | Major functionality & integration |
| Sprint 3 | Week 8 → Week 10 | Optimization & Final delivery |
