## üìö 1. Background (15%)

### a. Problem Definition and Impact

Speech and language disorders are common among children worldwide. Early diagnosis and continuous therapy are crucial for improving children's communication skills. Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) work with children to provide tailored exercises and monitor their progress. 

Current tablet-based solutions like Say66 provide interactive training but lack comprehensive management tools for therapists. SLPs often struggle to manage case files, monitor detailed progress over time, and generate individualized reports.

This project proposes a **database-driven web platform** that allows SLPs to efficiently:
- Manage children profiles
- Design and assign customized exercises
- Monitor progress with phoneme-level data
- Generate reports that aid therapy planning

### b. Review of Existing Systems

| System | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Speech Blubs** | Engaging interface, gamification attracts children | Lacks therapist management tools and detailed reporting |
| **Say66 Tablet Game (current)** | Interactive exercises, pronunciation assessment, JSON data export | No backend for therapist management, no data aggregation, no centralized reporting |

By addressing these gaps, our solution enhances the clinical workflow, improves data utilization, and empowers SLPs with actionable insights.

## üß© 2. User Stories and Sprints (25%)

### a. Scope Statement

> We will deliver a functional web-based system for SLPs to manage patients, create exercises, track detailed progress, and generate reports based on assessment data. The system includes a MySQL database, RESTful API backend (Flask or Node.js), React frontend, and Firebase integration for file storage. Tablet-side development and AI model development are out of scope.

**Client Approval**: Approved via email on 2025-06-15.

### c. Design Justifications

| Problem | Proposed Solution | Alternatives Considered | Reasoning |
|---------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| User Authentication | JWT with secure token | OAuth | Lightweight, stateless, secure |
| Database | MySQL | MongoDB | Structured data model fits relational schema |
| File Storage | Firebase | AWS S3 | Firebase already used by existing tablet system |
| Backend | Flask/Node.js | Django | Lightweight, faster development for API |
| Frontend | React | Vue.js | React flexible, large community support |

- The architecture avoids monolithic design by splitting business logic into service modules.
- Firebase integration minimizes unnecessary file duplication.
- RESTful APIs ensure future extensibility for mobile/tablet integration.
